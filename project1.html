        <p>I'm interested in and enjoy doing a lot of things, honestly. The MAIN things are photography, traveling, socializing with friends, playing tennis, learning new things (like coding!), and spending time outside.</p>
        <p>What do I do for a living? Currently I'm a Senior at TAMU-CC, majoring in Communication with a focus in media studies. I work as a New Media Intern on campus, helping to manage the University's social media accounts! I'm not sure what I want to do after college, but learning how to code is definitely going to help me with my goals!</p>
        <p>I actually REALLY love learning HTML! I starting with it and now I just want to spend all my time learning it. It's really cool! It makes me want to get to a point where I can build websites sometime!</P>
